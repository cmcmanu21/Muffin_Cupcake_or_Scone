### Overview:

This task came from Rob Abbott's Applied Machine Learning Class at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. The goal was not to create an SVM from scratch but to build on an existing one to predict an additional class (i.e. scones) and then create a decision tree classifier based on the SVM. The tasks were to download the data file that contained the muffins, cupcakes, and scones dataset and modify the SVM code in Juptyper notebook to properly predict all three classes. Then, use the same data file to create a decision tree classifier to predict the same three classes from the data.
